Checklist of settings in ecore

1) The root metaclass for your extension has an EAnnotation to list the allowable parents as the meta-classes that it extends (i.e. allowable parents)

CheckList of changes to genmodel

Model top node
1) Change containment proxies to true
 (so far there is no reason for containments to be across resource but this is done for consistency with core and in case extenders require it.)
2) Using dynamic templates as described below:
	i) Dynamic Templates = true
	ii) Template Directory = /org.eventb.emf.core/templates
	
Package Records
1) Change child creation extenders to true
2) Change extensible  provider factory to true


Checklist of post-gen code changes (considering changing the Jet templates for these)
1) in generated edit plugin -> plugin.xml, in the extension point childCreationExtenders, change the package URI to the one containing the allowable parents 
   (e.g. http://emf.eventb.org/models/core/context) The generator always sets it to core. N.b. if more than one package, add another 
   extension point
2) optional: edit providers to bypass the extension class in the editors (assuming the extension is not an element child).
4) make customisations as in the core packages for inter-resource referencing (i.e. reference names derived attributes)
5) make customisations for lazy proxy construction.


Dynamic Templates (Under development)

This allows the code generation to be customised so that the post-gen code changes above are not needed.
The EMF templates have been copied from org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore into org.eventb.emf.core
The templates have been customised as listed below.

Checklist of customisations to the code generation templates
1)ItemProviderAdapterFactory -This obviates the need for code change 1)
added: (in case method of creation switch (4th clause) - n.b. this may need to be done in other clauses in this method)
				EAnnotation annotation = <%=createClass.getQualifiedClassifierAccessor()%>.getEAnnotation("org.eventb.emf.core.extendedMetaClasses");
				if (annotation == null  || annotation.getReferences().contains(object.eClass()))


TBD: the mechanism 1) above works for parents in OTHER packages but it doesn't stop new children being offered all over THIS package. This is because the collectNewChildren 
methods are hard generated code for the itemproviders of the current package - they do not use the child extenders themselves. Currently, I have customised these methods as
 shown below but this could also be done in the jet templates to make it conditional on the extendedMetaClasses annotation references.
 
 	/**
	 * This adds {@link org.eclipse.emf.edit.command.CommandParameter}s describing the children that can be created under this object. <!-- begin-user-doc --> <!-- end-user-doc -->
	 * 
	 * @generated NOT
	 */
	@Override
	protected void collectNewChildDescriptors(Collection<Object> newChildDescriptors, Object object) {
		super.collectNewChildDescriptors(newChildDescriptors, object);

		//newChildDescriptors.add(createChildParameter(CorePackage.Literals.EVENT_BELEMENT__EXTENSIONS, RecordsFactory.eINSTANCE.createRecordCollection()));

		newChildDescriptors.add(createChildParameter(RecordsPackage.Literals.RECORD_COLLECTION__RECORD_DECLARATIONS, RecordsFactory.eINSTANCE.createRecord()));

		newChildDescriptors.add(createChildParameter(RecordsPackage.Literals.RECORD_COLLECTION__RECORD_EXTENSIONS, RecordsFactory.eINSTANCE
				.createRecordExtension()));
	}
 
TBD: Automatically select the correct sub package in the edit plugin childCreationExtender extension.
